# gb-apis
This repo is for a class that can connect to the giantbomb.com apis to retrieve video game-based information.
Everything was written with Python because I am learning to use Python as part of my career development.  

gbobjects.py contains the class methods to create the different objects based on wiki information

gbwiki.py contains the functions that make the API calls and return the special GB Class objects back to the functions that call them.

gbunittests.py contains the unit tests that are meant to confirm that any changes with gbwiki.py and gbobjects.py are functioning correctly.

Make sure that you look through the API information at giantbomb.com for their usage information.  All data from the APIs is
owned by giantbomb.com
